Android library for managing multiple stacks of fragments (e.g., Bottom Navigation ). This library does NOT include the UI for bottom tab bar layout. For that, I recommend either BottomBar (which is the library shown in the demo) or AHBottomNavigation. This library helps maintain order after pushing onto and popping from multiple stacks(tabs). It also helps with switching between desired tabs and clearing the stacks.
